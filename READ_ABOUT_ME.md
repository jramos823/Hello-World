# Hello-World
Hello all

My name is Joshua Ramos and this is where I will be storing some of my personal projects along with any writeups and solutions🤖 

I am currently a Computing and Security Technology student at Drexel University🐉. I have an expected Graduation date of June 2023!
I graduated from Northampton Community College with an Associate Degree in Computer Security🦾
I am currently looking for a Information Security/Cyber Security Co-op or internship💻
I do spend additional time trying to learn as much as I can by doing CTF challenges and trying to complete boxes on HTB. 

Some interst/hobbies outside of my education: 
  - I like going to the gym
  - I like hanging out with family/friends 
  - I also like sports some of my favorite teams are (Giants, Yankees, 76ers) 
  - I also used to really be into movies but recently have not been able to get into theaters :( 


For whatever reason you are here thanks for the read! Hopefully you find something of interest.
